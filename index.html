        <p class="text-center">Nikhil&nbsp;Soni</p>
        <p class="text-center">Feb 25, 2022</p>
        <p>The year is 2010 and tensions between the United States and Iran are high. Iran is on the verge of becoming the first middle eastern country to wield a nuclear weapon, and is making swift advances in the nuclear field. Within their massive facilities are heavy machinery called centrifuges, which enriches uranium for use in nuclear power. This year, it is revealed that hiding in these machines computers are a deadly cyberweapon called Stuxnet, a worm that spreads through the whole internet to find these specific machines, and bury themselves deep until the time is right to sabotage their hosts. For the first time in history, a major world power had used a cyber weapon as an act of sabotage against their enemy, and so began the arms race of the information age. Because of the rapid advancements in cyber weapon technology since the advent of Stuxnet, the United States should hold companies accountable for failing to protect users, and make heavy recurring investments in cyber defense and weapons to establish a foothold on this modern battlefield.</p>
        <p> Cyber warfare is not a new concept. Although it has only come into use in the 21st century, the concept of a malicious program has existed since 1988.&nbsp;On November 2, 1988, an email went around Berkeley claiming &ldquo;We are currently under attack&rdquo;. It only took a day before 6000 computers were infected, unprecedented for the 60,000 total computers connected to the internet at the time (FBI). Able to exploit many attack vectors within Unix based operating systems, this worm, dubbed the &ldquo;Morris Worm&rdquo; after its creator, slowed military, office, and education computer systems to a horrible crawl. The worm was removed quickly, but the damage had been done. The concept of a cyber weapon had become real, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be long until it was exploited for government use. </p>
        <p> Another cyber weapon that foreshadowed the rise of digital warfare was the Melissa Virus. Similar to the Morris Worm, Melissa was not an inherently dangerous program in that it did not steal information or destroy infrastructure, but it slowed email servers and corporate networks in a problematic way. The worm spread through a concept called &ldquo;Social Engineering&rdquo;, which is a cybersecurity term used to describe the usage of manipulation or bait against human targets in order to infect a system without breaking in directly. In Melissa&rsquo;s case, the worm spread via malicious files disguised as pornography, which when clicked spread the virus. The creator, David Lee Smith was hunted down by the FBI and cybersecurity officials, and was put away for 20 months plus a 5,000 dollar fine&nbsp;(FBI). However, this also served as a wakeup call for law enforcement. The FBI put its Cyber Division on the case of all online crimes, and security on the internet was ramped up because of this new threat. </p>
        <p> These attacks, however, were minor threats compared to the most famous cyber attack, Stuxnet. The Stuxnet virus was yet another piece of malware, but far more potent and malicious than the previous two examples. Created by the US Government during the Bush administration, this program was designed to cause industrial sabotage to nuclear plant centrifuges. In a nuclear reactor, the centrifuge is an important piece of equipment that enriches Uranium-235, and destroying this particular equipment would massively slow down Iran's progress in creating nuclear material for a weapon. Stuxnet was specifically designed to target the Siemens manufactured software and hardware systems that controlled the centrifuges in the Natanz nuclear plant. These systems monitored the speed and intensity of the nuclear centrifuges (Zetter). The problem facing US intelligence officials in charge of this attack was that these computer systems lacked the primary attack vector: The Internet. This meant that the agents would have to put flash drives with the worms hidden on them into the hands of unwitting individuals from nuclear companies, each having some connection to the Iranian plant. Soon after, exploiting a print spooler zero day exploit, Stuxnet attacked two of those companies, and within another two weeks, a user of the Siemens equipment reported mass issues with a certain .dll file (Zetter). However, no malware could be discerned from scans. Uncoincidentally, the efficiency of the Natanz centrifuges plummeted by&nbsp;328 centrifuges in total (Zetter), with even more being shut down in the coming months. Not only that, but the new centrifuges would not be fed gas, despite just being installed. This attack was the first use of a cyberweapon against a foreign enemy, and as such marks an important milestone in the future of warfare. The ability to shut down critical infrastructure for energy and warfare, in the case of Stuxnet, and the ability of the two worms mentioned prior to take office and military devices down to a crawl should be incredibly worrying to any American. For the first time in history, unknown entities can terrorize regular people with attacks from another country, and suffer no physical consequences themselves.</p>
        <p>Even before Stuxnet was exposed to the world, governments everywhere were beginning to utilize cyberweapons in warfare. In April of 2007, riots erupted in Estonia over the moving of a Soviet statue, after fake news from Russian media claimed that war graves were being destroyed (McGuinness). By the 27th, Estonia was struck by mass cyber attacks, taking down banks, news media, and government sites. Quoting Liisa Past of Estonia&rsquo;s Information System Authority on the nature of these types of attacks: "It allows you to create confusion, while staying well below the level of an armed attack. Such attacks are not specific to tensions between the West and Russia. All modern societies are vulnerable&rdquo; (McGuinness). As a result of these attacks, Estonian citizens were left confused, without news, or ability to access their savings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Luckily, officials were able to restore connectivity to these services in the coming weeks, but one can easily imagine the resulting chaos if such an attack were to come to the United States, especially in large population centers such as New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles. For this reason, citizens of the United States should bring cybersecurity into their everyday lives, and always be considering the consequences of their actions in terms of privacy and security. In fact, 75% of people polled by Security Magazine reuse their passwords online (Security Magazine). While this does not sound necessarily bad at face value, hackers have a trivially easy job at catching passwords that most people use.&nbsp;Tools like Hydra, John The Ripper, Gobuster, and others run through wordlists built by hacking communities and once a password comes through, it notifies the attacker of the correct password. Using these tools in tandem with word lists such as RockYou.txt, containing 14,341,564 passwords leaked from RockYou.com, even amateur hackers can find themselves with access to hundreds of accounts who reuse their passwords on social media sites and the like. </p>
        <p>Just in 2013, a massive attack breached popular software maker Adobe&rsquo;s servers, stealing passwords and account information from 38 million users (BBC). These types of attacks spread the passwords all over the internet into new word lists, and passwords one might think are safe may in fact have been put onto these lists. The consequences of these types of vulnerabilities should be clear to all, especially in the age of information warfare. Whoever controls the narrative controls the people, and being able to manipulate social media accounts and news sites, even temporarily, can cause mass confusion, and stoke conflicts if used correctly.</p>
        <p>Cyber weapons are clearly a large threat to any country; extremely difficult to pin on a specific country or individual, devastating to civilian and military infrastructure alike, and without risk of fatality for the assailant, this technology is certainly highly effective. However, there are solutions which should be taken into consideration immediately by both the private and public sector, as well as by the military. In the private sector, corporations should be held to a high standard by inspectors from the FCC, and heavily fined for failing to implement security practices within their internal networks, and applications. Companies like Amazon, who&rsquo;s Amazon Web Services hosts a whopping 33% of the internet (Runkevicius)&nbsp;should have frequent quality inspections for maintaining server uptime, preventing intrusion of all types on the web, whether it be cross site scripting attacks, SQL server injection, or Authentication Failure. The government has made steps in the right direction by fining those who did not take appropriate steps to defend users against the dangerous &ldquo;log4j&rdquo; Java exploit, and further economic penalties will be useful in dissuading tech companies from lacking in security measures, especially in the SaaS and IaaS sectors (Software as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service respectively). </p>
        <p>Secondly, the US military should make recurring investments in cybersecurity and cyber weapons. As of now, Congress has made a 2 billion dollar investment in cybersecurity in this sector (sdxcentral), but recurring investment and review will be required to maintain not only a solid line of defense for military infrastructure online, gas pipeline and natural resource controls, but also offensive technologies and budget for cyber assault operations, similar to the attack using Stuxnet, should be considered heavily, as it offers the perfect avenue for retaliation and counter attacks against those who would threaten NATO and the rest of the free world. The recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia has demonstrated the significance of cyber warfare in the 21st century. As Stuart Madnick states in Harvard Business Review: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to understand why Ukraine is an appealing target for testing cyberwar capabilities. The country has similar infrastructure to that found in Western Europe and North America. But unlike the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union (EU), Ukraine has more limited resources to counter-attack (though the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USAID_UkraineCybersecurityChallenge_CaseStudy_final.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1652893673411830&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HksNt-O9HD01JAyzaSCsW">U.S.</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2022/02/22/european-union-cyber-defense-team-deploys-to-aid-ukraine/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1652893673412183&amp;usg=AOvVaw2X-Fzah-bIhyDt29OcEwOp">EU</a>&nbsp;have both provided support in bolstering its cyber defenses). And while Russia is the obvious suspect, it&rsquo;s certainly possible that other countries, such as Iran, North Korea, or China, have been testing their own cyber weaponry in Ukraine, too&rdquo; (HBR). The forward thinking leader would use this unprecedented time to test cyberweapons for the first time by NATO in a major conflict, and may be a turning point for bringing cyber warfare into the forefront of modern war.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, cyber warfare has become a strong force in the modern battlefield, and only continues to grow stronger with advances in technology each year. With advancements in password cracking software, account leaks, and military research on breaking into systems, threats to critical civil and military infrastructure will only grow if this threat is not dealt with. Looking to the past with incidents such as the Morris Worm, Melissa Virus, and Stuxnet worm, and to the present in Ukraine, we must use our knowledge of these groundbreaking events to inform ourselves on the solutions for the future. The United States federal government must make cyber warfare a priority both domestically and globally to ensure the safety of all citizens in a whole new threat environment by making recurring investments into cyber weapons and defense, and by holding companies that do not adequately protect infrastructure to high accountability. It is no longer enough to apologize and engage with sluggish incident response, rather it is time for bold action in cyberspace before the United States faces an attack on the civil and military sector unseen since the likes of 9/11 and the Pearl Harbor attacks. Civilian lives count on it.</p>
